# `.sdlc/` state schema

All SDLC state lives in plain files under `epics/EP-<slug>/.sdlc/` (build plan §1: "All state lives
in files on disk. Nothing hidden."). No database, no browser storage.

## `state.json`
The per-epic state machine.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `epicId` | The stable `EP-<slug>` ID. Never renamed. |
| `createdAt` | ISO date the epic was created. |
| `currentStep` | `id` of the step the workflow is waiting on right now. |
| `steps[]` | Ordered list of every front-state step. |

Each `steps[]` entry:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `id` | `epic`, `epic-review`, `architecture`, `architecture-review`, `ui-design`, `ui-design-review`, `stories`, `stories-review` | Step identity. |
| `type` | `author` \| `review+approve` | Authoring step or a team review gate. |
| `artifact` | filename or folder | The file/folder this step produces or gates. |
| `assistance` | `none` \| `review` \| `heavy` | Dial 1 — how much AI helps (build plan §2). |
| `automation` | `human_approve` \| `machine_advance` | Dial 2 — who advances (build plan §2). |
| `locked` | `true` \| `false` | Front steps are `true`: may NOT be set to `machine_advance` in this version. |
| `status` | `blocked` \| `in_progress` \| `in_review` \| `done` | Lifecycle. `blocked` = upstream step not yet approved. |
| `risk_tags` | subset of `contract`, `auth`, `payments` | Drives review escalation (build plan §4). |

## `approvals.json`
Append-only ledger (an array). Each entry:

```json
{ "artifact": "epic.md", "step": "epic-review", "approver": "<name>", "role": "owner|reviewer|domain-owner", "domain": "<repo-or-area, optional>", "status": "approved", "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>" }
```

## `reviews/`
Human-readable review records, one file per round:
`reviews/<artifact-base>--<YYYY-MM-DD>--<status>.md` where `status` ∈ `comments` | `approved`
and `<artifact-base>` is the artifact without extension (e.g. `epic`, `architecture`, `stories-S01`).

## Dial defaults & locks
- Every step defaults to `automation: human_approve` (build plan §2).
- The four authoring front steps and their reviews are `locked: true` — the engine refuses to set
  them to `machine_advance` in this version (build plan §1, §8.7). Only back states (build pipeline,
  steps 9–14) may move toward machine-advance in a later iteration.
